## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm, pnpm, or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Demo Setup (one command)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (set `AUTH_SECRET`, keep `ENABLE_DEMO_DATA=true`),
start PostgreSQL (`docker compose up -d`), then:

```bash
pnpm demo:setup
```

This runs migrations and provisions the built-in demo tenant:

- Organization: **Meridian Financial Group** with the full deterministic SOC dataset
- Account: **demo@svalbard.ca** / **Demo123** (admin)

Sign in at `/signin` — the demo account lands directly in the seeded tenant.
The command is safe to run repeatedly: it preserves modifications made during
demo sessions; `pnpm demo:setup --reset` restores the pristine dataset.

`ENABLE_DEMO_DATA` is required (no default). Customer deployments must set it
to `false`, which disables both `demo:setup` and the in-app seed API.

Project state documentation lives in `docs/status/` — one document per
completed task or milestone (see `docs/status/TEMPLATE.md`).

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
